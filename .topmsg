Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mptcp: Capture pcap on both sender and receiver

When investigating performance issues that involve
latency/loss/reordering it is useful to have the pcap from the
sender-side as it allows to easier infer the state of the sender's
congestion-control, loss-recovery,...

Allow the selftests to capture a pcap on both sides so that this
information is not lost when reproducing.

This patch also improves the file names. Instead of:

  ns4-5ee79a56-X4O6gS-ns3-5ee79a56-X4O6gS-MPTCP-MPTCP-10.0.3.1.pcap

We now have something like:

  5ee79a56-X4O6gS-ns3-ns4-MPTCP-MPTCP-10.0.3.1-10030-connector.pcap
  5ee79a56-X4O6gS-ns3-ns4-MPTCP-MPTCP-10.0.3.1-10030-listener.pcap

It was a connection from ns3 to ns4, better to start with ns3 then. The
port is also added, easier to find the trace we want.
