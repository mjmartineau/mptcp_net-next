Subject: [PATCH] bpf: fix unused-var without NETDEVICES

A recent commit added new variables only used if CONFIG_NETDEVICES is
set. A simple fix is to only declare these variables if the same
condition is valid.

Other solutions could be to move the code related to SO_BINDTODEVICE
option from _bpf_setsockopt() function to a dedicated one or only
declare these variables in the related "case" section.

Fixes: 70c58997c1e8 ("bpf: Allow SO_BINDTODEVICE opt in bpf_setsockopt")
