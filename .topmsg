Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: don't leak msk in token container

When the left-over msk is freed by subflow_syn_recv_sock(),
we don't invoke the proto->destroy() method, to the socket
is not removed from the token container, leading to later
UaF.

Address the issue explicitly removing the token even in the
above error path.
