Subject: [PATCH] net: mptcp: improve fallback to TCP

keep using MPTCP sockets and a "dummy mapping" in case of fallback to
regular TCP. Skip adding DSS option on send, if TCP fallback has been
done earlier.

Notes: I'm unsure on what to do in mptcp_clean_una() to do a one-time
flush of the retransmit queue, as per Mat's suggestion. Any advice?

Changes since v1
 - rebase on top of Paolo's fix for NULL dereference in mptcp_recvmsg()

Changes since RFC v2:
 - use a bit in msk->flags, rather than a dedicated boolean in struct
   msk. This bit is going to be used in combination with another one,
   TCP_FALLBACK_ALLOWED, that is 1 at the first subflow creation
   and gets cleared once TCP fallback is no more allowed.
 - separate code that adds support for "infinite mapping", and use
   the term "dummy" instead of "infinite". Suggested by Mat
 - remove inappropriate call to __mptcp_do_fallback() in
   mptcp_accept() (Paolo)

Changes since RFC v1:
 - use a dedicated member of struct msk to indicate that a fallback
   ha happened, use it in case of infinite mapping
 - don't delete skb_ext in case of infinite mapping (Mat)
 - test the value of pm.subflows on reception of an infinite map to
   ensure that no other subflow is currently opened (Mat)
 - in mptcp_established_options(), avoid adding TCP options in case
   of fallback indication; simplify sendmsg()/recvmsg()/poll() to
   keep using the MPTCP socket in case of TCP fallback. Set the
   fallback indication in case subflow is not mp_capable after
   successful 3-way handshake, instead of flipping 'is_mptcp'
   (Paolo/Mat)
 - remove deadcode in mptcp_finish_connect, and increment
   MPTCP_MIB_MPCAPABLEACTIVEFALLBACK in subflow_finish_connect
   (Paolo)
